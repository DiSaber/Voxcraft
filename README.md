# Voxcraft
Download the .zip file and extract it. Run the Voxcraft.exe file to play the game! When you create a world a new folder will appear in the same directory as the Voxcraft.exe. The is called voxelGameSaves and it has all your worlds in it. To import a world you just take any Voxcraft world folder and put it in voxelGameSaves. To export a world just take your world folder in voxelGameSaves and copy it somewhere so you can share it with someone.
